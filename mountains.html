 <ul>
<li>Sigiriya or the mount of remembrance is a World Heritage Site and one of the most stunning places to see in Sri Lanka. </li>
<li>This giant formation of rock rises out of nowhere towering over everything in its vicinity.</li>
 <li>The rock fortress is a slice of history perched on a rock and is really worth a visit.</li>
<li>Sigiriya Rock Fort is utterly impressive. The rock walls rise up 200 meters from the ground, only to give way to a flat plateau at their summit.</li>
 <li>There are steep stairwells to reach the top and many frescos to marvel at on the way up. At the top, you can find the remains of an ancient civilization, including relics of a palace and monastery.
<li>It would have taken true engineering ingenuity to build a structure at this height so many centuries ago. Around the rock fort are many important caves and gardens; 
impressively, they are some of the first landscaped gardens in the world.</li>

<li>This mountain has a forest reserve in the surrounding location which was subjected to severe damage, five years ago in a forest fire. </li>

<li> However, with time and the help of the people of Sri Lanka, a lot of the damage has been repaired and is still improving every day.</li>
<li> The mountain summit of Pidurutalagala acts as a base of the communications array of the Sri Lankan government and armed forces.</li> 
 <li>It is marked as an ultra-high-security zone due to the confidentiality of the activities in the region. 
 <li>These are the best mountains in Sri Lanka in contrast to the lush green surroundings, 
 consisting of forests with a large variety of rare and endemic species of plants and animals. </li>
 <li>The mountain summit gives one the chance to have a glance at the beautiful country of Sri Lanka and is a perfect panorama.</li>
