<h1>Galle </h1>

<li> Meanwhile, snake charmers and buskers line the seawall.</li>
<li>However, the fort was not always such a cosmopolitan spot.</li>
 <li>A basic fort was constructed by the Portuguese when they made their first landing to the island in 1505.</li>
 <li>When the Dutch eventually seized control of Galle, they made a number of improvements; including the enormous sea wall that still lines the fort. </li>
 <li>Galle Fort is an excellent example of what the synthesis between European and Asian architecture looks like.</li>

<h1>Matale Aluviharaya</h1>
<p>
<img  src ="img/aluviharaya.jpg" align= "right"width= "400px" height="300px"> <br></br>
<li>The Aloka Vihara became Aluvihara. Folklore has many meanings to the name Aluvihara. </li>
<li>One is that the Pali word Aloka was Alu (light) in ancient Sinhala and as it was the abode of Theras, it was a Viharaya. </li>
<li>Hence the two words have been coined to make it Aluvihara.</li>
<li>Another view is that although there is a huge rock, east of the main rock cave, it has not cut off the light . Therefore it was known as the Aloka lena (cave with light).</li>
<li>Surrounded by hills, the famous Aluvihara cave temple 30 km south of Kandy on the Matale-Dambulla road is of great historic importance.</li>
 <li>The history of Aluvihara is traced back to the 3rd Century B.C in the reign of King Devanampiyatissa. It is believed that the King built the dagoba and planted the Bo sapling.</li> 
 <li>The Ven. Dr. Inamaluwe Nandarathana Thera had cleared three caves that were overgrown with shrubs and buried under soil just three years ago. </li>
<li> He remembered seeing these buried rocks as a young child when he came to the temple premises. He used his own funds and cleared the caves.</li>
<li>One cave he explains as being the kitchen. There is a broken section of what he explained as a wall and the roof is black which he attributes to the soot.</li>
 <li>Now on Poya days people come to observe ‘Sil’ and meditate in these caves. </li>
<li> He believes that there are still other hidden caves and hopes some day to locate and clear these as well.</li>
<li>To Enter the Aluvihara one has to climb a number of steps. In the Viharaya is a rock cave with paintings and statues in it. </li>
<li>The Ven. Dr. Inamaluwe Nandarathana Thera explained that the paintings are of ‘Anothattha Vila’ “Dahamsonda Jatakaya, Huridattha Jatakaya, “Maithri Bodhisattva’ and a few others.</li> 
<li>In another section. the ‘Vessantara Jatakaya’ has been painted. </li>
<li>At the entrance there is a ” Makara Thorana ‘, figures of ‘Doratupala’ , paintings of lions and flags with the sun and moon.</li>

<h1>Gangaramaya Temple</h1>
<p>
<img  src ="img/gangaramaya.jpg" align= "right"width= "400px" height="300px"> <br></br>
<li>Gangaramaya is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Colombo, started by the famous scholar monk Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Nayaka Thera in the late 19th Century.</li>
<li>After the Venerable Sri Sumangala, his chief pupil Devundera Sri Jinaratana Nayake Thera took on the administration of the temple.</li>
 <li>It was he who laid the foundation to convert the little temple to an institute of international reckoning.</li>
<li>The next chief incumbent was the Ven. Devundara Keerthi Sri Sumangala Jinaratana Vacissara Thera, the teacher of the Ven. Galboda Gnanissara, 
who worked to make the Gangaramaya what it is today: much more than a temple in the conventional term, but a place of worship, a seat of learning and a cultural centre.</li>

<h1>Kelaniya Temple</h1>
<p>
<img  src ="img/kelaniya1.jpg" align= "right"width= "400px" height="300px"> <br></br>
<li>The temple has often been associated with the rise and fall of Sri Lanka,</li>
 <li>with the popular saying that as the Kelaniya temple rose, Sri Lanka rose and as it fell, the country and its administration fell. </li>
 <li>It has thus had a deep association with the political powers of the country.</li>
<li>The temple is also famous for its image of the reclining Gautama Buddha and paintings by the native artist Solias Mendis which depict important events in the life of the Buddha,
 in the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, also incidents from the Jataka tales.</li>
 <li>It is the venue for the Duruthu Maha Perehera procession each January. </li>
 <li>An 18-foot stone statue of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara has been erected at the temple.</li>
